# Anon

Workplace harassment faced by women by male coworkers which threatens their security, sanity and mental stability.
Destabilization of workplace environment leading to unsafe and vulnerable state of mind.

### SOLUTION:
- Provisioning of anonymous online reporting against harassment most women face in their workplace.
- Usage of blockchain will ensure anonymity of the individual and reduce chances of spam reports.
- Burnt token due to illegitimate reports will direct to a common pool, which can be used for women in need.
- Women buying/selling (ERC-20) Tokens on any public blockchain network will ensure a stable income for the women, hence ensuring financial development of the individual.

### USERS:
- Corporate workers who face harrasment in the workplace.
- Women who want to ensure complete anonymity while reporting a case.

### WORKING:
- User files a report after approving the certain amount of ERC-20 Token for the transaction.
- These tokens are kept as a deposit against the report filed.
- Once, the report is filed, a reverse stream is started to return the deposited token amount back to the reporter at a certain rate.
- If the admin marks the report as a false accusation, the amount deposited against the report is burnt and the remaining amount is NOT returned back to the reporter.
- This ensures the reports are as legitimate as possible.

### Future Scope:
- Additional chat feature for admin to get more proofs if required.
- Provisioning of additional platform to talk to professional experts anonymously.
- Could be available publicly for everyone for reporting cases of cyber-bullying and online sexual harassment. 
- Scope for reporting of online harassment with proofs (screenshots) to cyber security department.
- The tokens collected from spam reports can be directed to a common pool, thereby can be used for the welfare of the victims.
